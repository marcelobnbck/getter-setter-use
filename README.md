# Java Getters and Setters Example

This repository contains a simple Java example demonstrating the fundamental concept of **encapsulation** using **Getters** and **Setters**.

It features a `Person` class with private fields and public methods to access and modify this data in a controlled manner, adhering to standard JavaBeans conventions.

## Files

*   **`Person.java`**: Defines the `Person` class with private fields (`name`, `age`, `employed`) and their corresponding public getters and setters. Includes basic validation in `setAge()` and `setName()`.
*   **`Main.java`**: A simple driver class that creates `Person` objects, uses the getter methods to retrieve data, and uses the setter methods to modify data. It also demonstrates the validation logic in action.

## Prerequisites

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed.
    *   You can check your installation by running `java -version` in your terminal or command prompt.

## How to Run

** Using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment):**

   a.  Clone or download the repository.
   b.  Import the project into your favorite Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code with Java extensions).
   c.  Locate the `Main.java` file.
   d.  Right-click on `Main.java` and select "Run" or "Run As Java Application". The output will appear in the IDE's console.
